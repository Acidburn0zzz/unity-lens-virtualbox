VirtualBox Unity Lens Daemon written in Python
-----------------------------------------------

Credits
-------
This lens is based on the gdocs sample lens writen by njpatel which can 
be found on launchpad.
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~njpatel/unity-lens-gdocs/trunk/files

Most of this code is copy paste

Dependencies
------------
Introspection data for libunity, libdee, and libdbusmenu-glib

gir1.2-unity-4.0
gir1.2-dee-0.5
gir1.2-dbusmenu-glib-0.4

Trying out the lens
-------------------

There is no installation script for this so to get Unity to pick
this up you need to:

  sudo mkdir /usr/share/unity/lenses/vbox
  sudo cp vbox.lens /usr/share/unity/lenses/vbox/

Then run the daemon with:

  ./unity-lens-vbox.py

And from another terminal restart Unity like this:

  setsid unity

[the setsid ^^ is a small trick to detach the unity process from the terminal
 so you can close it if you want. A bit like 'unity &' just better ;-) ]

Past this step you can freely Control-C the lens daemon to stop it,
do some changes, and restart it. No need to restart Unity, it will find
the newly started daemon automatically.

Getting rid of the Lens
-------------------------------
Just remove the vbox.lens file. Fx, by issuing:

  sudo rm /usr/share/unity/lenses/vbox/vbox.lens

With that done, restart Unity once again with 'setsid unity' and all should
be back to normal.
